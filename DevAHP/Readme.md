## DevAHP toolkit
This is a Python / Jupyter toolkit for performing some standard AHP calculations in Python/Jupyter

### Currently supported calculations
1. Reading in group pairwise comparisons from an Excel file using the better/much better scale
2. Calculating individual priorities where you can:
  1. Change the meaning of better/much better
  2. Flip the doppelganger flag and see the doppelganger priorities
  3. See either the priority values, or immediately see the priority graph in Jupyter
3. Calculating group priorities where you can:
  1. Change the meaning of better/much better
  2. Flip the doppelganger flag and see the doppelganger priorities
  3. See either the priority values, or immediately see the priority graph in Jupyter
  4. By default it calculates the whole group, but you can choose to synthesize a subset as well

### Quickstart
There is a quickstart guide available at [docs/Quickstart.pdf](docs/Quickstart.pdf)
