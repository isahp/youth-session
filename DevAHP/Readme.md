## Python AHP Library
This is the beginnings of a python library to do AHP related calculations.  Currently it is limited to

1. Converting pairwise comparisons to priorities.
2. It can use the Better/Much Better scale.
3. It reads inputs from specially setup Excel files.

- [ ] Handle calculating the geometric average matrix for a group of participants
- [ ] Handle calculating the priorities then for a group of participants.
- [ ] Think about how to make a video showing someone how to get started using your library.
