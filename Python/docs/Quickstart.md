# Quickstart Guide to DevAHP
This document will get you up and running Devin Tamayoâ€™s Jupyter notebooks that can 
perform many of the standard AHP pairwise calculations, as well as provide useful visualizations of the results.

## 1 Installing Jupyter and Python
The DevAHP project uses the Jupyter notebook system and is written in Python.  Thus you need to install Jupyter and Python.  Luckily there is an easy way to install both (continue)

## 2 Getting the DevAHP Source Code
Jupyter/Python notebooks are simply source code that is run in a Jupyter notebook environment.  DevAHP is such a notebook and is hosted on GitHub.  (Devin explain here how to get the code from github)

## 3 Getting Extra Libraries Needed By Python
We rely on an xlsx python library, in addition to a visualization library called plotly.  You need to install those libraries for the DevAHP Jupyter workbook to function.

## 4 Running the sample notebooks
Explain here how to
Launch Jupyter
Navigate to and open the sample notebooks
Maybe include a screenshot of what it should look like
Explain how to execute one cell/all cells in a notebook
